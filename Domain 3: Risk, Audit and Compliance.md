# CCSK Domain 3: Risk, Audit, and Compliance – Study Content

## 1. Cloud Risk Management

### Key Concepts:
- **Cloud-Specific Risks**:
  - Identity & Access Management (IAM) Weaknesses
  - Insecure Interfaces & APIs
  - Misconfigurations (e.g., open S3 buckets)
  - Lack of Cloud Security Architecture
  - Insecure Development Practices (container, serverless vulnerabilities)

### Focus Areas:
- **Risk Identification**: Understand threats like misconfigurations, APTs, and how they impact cloud environments.
- **Threat Modeling**: Be able to recognize cloud assets, attackers, vulnerabilities, and how to mitigate them.
- **Cloud Threat Reports**: Review CSA’s “Top Threats to Cloud Computing” reports and the “Pandemic Eleven.”

### Practice:
- Identify real-world examples of cloud risks (e.g., data exfiltration from open cloud storage).
- Perform a basic threat model for a cloud environment.

## 2. Risk Assessment and Treatment

### Key Concepts:
- **Risk Assessment Process**:
  - Identify Threats and Vulnerabilities: Map threats to assets.
  - Evaluate Risk Impact: Measure risk based on likelihood and severity.
  - Assess Cloud Providers: Use CAIQ and CSP documentation to evaluate providers.

- **Risk Treatment Approaches**:
  - **Mitigation**: Apply controls to reduce risk.
  - **Transfer**: Shift risk (e.g., insurance or contracts with CSPs).
  - **Acceptance**: Acknowledge residual risk.

### Focus Areas:
- **ENISA Risk Management Process**: Familiarize yourself with frameworks like ENISA for managing cloud-specific risks.
- **Cloud Provider Risk Assessment**: Understand the process of reviewing CSP documentation, SLAs, and certifications (e.g., ISO 27001).

### Practice:
- Define steps to treat a specific cloud risk (e.g., insecure API endpoints).

## 3. Compliance and Audits

### Key Concepts:
- **Key Regulations and Standards**:
  - GDPR (Data privacy in the EU)
  - CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)
  - HIPAA (US Health Information Privacy)
  - PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Security Standards)

- **Cloud-Specific Compliance**:
  - Know how to handle compliance in multi-jurisdictional environments.
  - Understand compliance inheritance: When you inherit compliance from your CSP but still need to ensure your own application compliance.

- **Audit Artifacts**:
  - Logs: Security event logs, audit trails.
  - System Configuration Documentation: Track changes and ensure audit readiness.

### Focus Areas:
- **Regulations and Jurisdictions**: Be aware of how compliance works across different regions (e.g., storing EU data under GDPR while using a US cloud provider).
- **Compliance Tools**: Learn how the Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) and the Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ) help ensure cloud compliance.

### Practice:
- Create an audit plan including compliance documentation requirements (e.g., data retention logs).

## 4. Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) Tools and Technologies

### Key Concepts:
- **Governance Frameworks**:
  - Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM)
  - ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management System)

- **Risk Register**: Maintain a cloud risk register to track identified risks, treatment strategies, and the current risk status.

- **Shared Responsibility Model**:
  - CSP vs. Customer Responsibilities: Understand the division of responsibility in SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS models.

### Focus Areas:
- **GRC Automation Tools**: Familiarize yourself with tools that automate compliance checks, audits, and risk management tasks.
- **Risk Register Example**: Study how to maintain and update a risk register for cloud assets and risks.

### Practice:
- Build a simple cloud risk register with entries for misconfigured storage, API vulnerabilities, etc.

## 5. Cloud Risk Assessment Frameworks

### Key Concepts:
- **Compliance Frameworks**:
  - ISO 27001: Security management certification.
  - SOC 2: System and Organization Controls for SaaS providers.
  - CSA STAR: Security, Trust, Assurance, and Risk program for CSPs.

- **Audit Readiness**: Know what compliance artifacts are required for audits and how to prepare your environment for them.

### Focus Areas:
- **Cloud Security Maturity Models**: Understand how these frameworks guide organizations from basic cloud security to mature, automated processes.
- **Compliance Inheritance**: Learn which controls you can inherit from your CSP, and which remain your responsibility.

### Practice:
- Map ISO 27001 controls to a cloud environment and identify gaps.

## 6. Example Cloud Risk and Compliance Scenarios

### Scenarios to Revise:
- **Scenario 1**: You are using an AWS S3 bucket to store sensitive customer data. How would you ensure compliance with GDPR and prevent a data breach?
- **Scenario 2**: Your team is migrating healthcare data to the cloud. What steps must you take to comply with HIPAA regulations, and what controls must you audit?

---

## 7. Important Definitions to Remember
- **Cloud Risk**: A potential event that negatively impacts cloud services (e.g., data breaches, DDoS attacks).
- **Shared Responsibility Model**: The distribution of security responsibilities between a CSP and the customer.
- **Compliance Inheritance**: The ability to inherit compliant controls from a CSP for shared services.
- **Audit Artifacts**: Logs, records, and documentation that demonstrate compliance.
