# CCSK Domain 4: Organization Management – Study Content

## 1. Organization Hierarchy Models

### Key Concepts:
- **Understanding Cloud Hierarchy**:
  - **Organization**: Top-level structure within a Cloud Service Provider (CSP).
  - **Group**: A collection of deployments under an organization.
  - **Deployment**: Isolated environment within a CSP for applications and services.

### Focus Areas:
- Learn the hierarchical terminology used by different CSPs (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud):
  - **AWS**: Organization, Organizational Units (OUs), Accounts
  - **Azure**: Tenant, Management Groups, Subscriptions
  - **Google Cloud**: Organizations, Folders, Projects
- **Segmentation**: Structure cloud environments to reduce the impact of adverse events by isolating deployments.
- **Standardization**: Use CSP landing zones and account factories for standardized deployment and management.

### Practice:
- Create an organization hierarchy for an enterprise with multiple applications using AWS or Azure.

## 2. Managing Organization-Level Security within a CSP

### Key Concepts:
- **Identity Provider**: Controls access to deployments, groups, and users.
- **Root Access**: Minimize root access to avoid high-level alterations.
- **Policy Management**: Implement policies to control services, API calls, and regions within the organization hierarchy.

### Focus Areas:
- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Centralized identity management ensures users' access is consistent across multiple deployments.
- **Policies**: Manage security settings (e.g., API restrictions, geographic constraints, IAM rules) at the group or deployment level.
- **Shared Services**: Use centralized logging and security telemetry for threat detection and analysis.

### Practice:
- Design IAM roles and policies for a multi-cloud environment that limit root access and enforce security controls across multiple deployments.

## 3. Security Considerations for Hybrid & Multi-Cloud Deployments

### Key Concepts:
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Integrating on-premises data centers with public cloud services (e.g., via VPN or dedicated links).
- **Multi-Cloud**: Using multiple IaaS/PaaS providers to avoid vendor lock-in or meet unique requirements.

### Focus Areas:
- **Hybrid Cloud Security**: Ensure secure integration between on-premises and cloud environments, focusing on IAM and network security.
- **Multi-Cloud Strategy**: Implement security policies across multiple cloud providers with minimal friction and consistency in management.
- **Shared Services**: Centralized cost management, IAM, and logging across hybrid/multi-cloud deployments.

### Practice:
- Plan a hybrid cloud deployment ensuring that both cloud and on-premise environments are secured and that IAM roles are unified.

## 4. Key Strategies for Multi-Cloud Management

### Key Concepts:
- **Single Provider Model**: Stick to a primary CSP to avoid security complexity.
- **Primary/Secondary Model**: Use a primary CSP for most workloads, with a secondary CSP for specific tasks.
- **Full Multi-Cloud Model**: Full support for two or more CSPs, but requires maturity and in-depth cloud knowledge.

### Focus Areas:
- **Multi-Cloud Expertise**: Each CSP has unique features, requiring dedicated expertise for each provider.
- **Tools for Multi-Cloud**: Ensure centralized tools for logging, monitoring, and security automation across providers.

### Practice:
- Compare the operational security requirements for adopting a single-CSP vs. a full multi-cloud strategy.

## 5. Tooling & Staffing for Multi-Cloud

### Key Concepts:
- **Cloud Expertise**: Developing cloud skills or outsourcing to Managed Service Providers (MSPs).
- **Shared Security Services**: Ensure logging, IAM, and threat detection are centralized across all cloud providers.

### Focus Areas:
- Focus on specialized staffing or outsourcing for complex multi-cloud security needs.
- Understand cloud-specific shared services such as centralized logging and monitoring across deployments.
