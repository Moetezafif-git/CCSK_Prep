# Cloud Computing Overview

## Defining Cloud Computing

### NIST Definition
The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines cloud computing as:
> A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

### ISO/IEC Definition
The ISO/IEC also provides a definition:
> A paradigm for enabling network access to a scalable and elastic pool of shareable physical or virtual resources with self-service provisioning and administration on-demand.

Both definitions emphasize the abstraction of resources (like computing power and storage) that are shared and accessible via network, allowing organizations to optimize costs and scale rapidly.

## Cloud Computing Models

Cloud computing models are broadly categorized based on NIST and ISO/IEC standards.

### Service Models:
1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Access to fundamental computing resources like virtual machines, storage, and networks.

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: A platform for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure.

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Complete applications that are hosted and managed by the service provider, accessed through web browsers or APIs.

## Deployment Models

Cloud computing can be deployed in the following models:
- **Public Cloud**: The cloud infrastructure is provided to the general public or a large industry group by a cloud service provider.
- **Private Cloud**: Dedicated to a single organization, providing more control but with less scalability.
- **Hybrid Cloud**: A combination of public and private clouds bound by technology that allows for data and application portability.
- **Community Cloud**: Infrastructure shared between several organizations with common concerns.

## Reference and Architecture Models

Cloud computing reference models, as described in NIST and ISO/IEC standards, provide a structural framework. This includes service and deployment models, with a shared responsibility between the cloud service provider and the cloud customer.

- **Shared Responsibility Model**: In this model, responsibilities vary depending on the service model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), with the provider managing the infrastructure and the customer managing the applications and data.
