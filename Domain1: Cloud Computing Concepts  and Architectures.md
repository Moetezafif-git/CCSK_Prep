# Cloud Computing Overview

## Defining Cloud Computing

### NIST Definition
The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines cloud computing as:
> A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

### ISO/IEC Definition
The ISO/IEC also provides a definition:
> A paradigm for enabling network access to a scalable and elastic pool of shareable physical or virtual resources with self-service provisioning and administration on-demand.

Both definitions emphasize the abstraction of resources (like computing power and storage) that are shared and accessible via network, allowing organizations to optimize costs and scale rapidly.

## Cloud Computing Models

Cloud computing models are broadly categorized based on NIST and ISO/IEC standards.

### Service Models:
1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Access to fundamental computing resources like virtual machines, storage, and networks.
2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: A platform for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure.
3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Complete applications that are hosted and managed by the service provider, accessed through web browsers or APIs.

## Deployment Models

Cloud computing can be deployed in the following models:
- **Public Cloud**: The cloud infrastructure is provided to the general public or a large industry group by a cloud service provider.
- **Private Cloud**: Dedicated to a single organization, providing more control but with less scalability.
- **Hybrid Cloud**: A combination of public and private clouds bound by technology that allows for data and application portability.
- **Community Cloud**: Infrastructure shared between several organizations with common concerns.

## Reference and Architecture Models

Cloud computing reference models, as described in NIST and ISO/IEC standards, provide a structural framework. This includes service and deployment models, with a shared responsibility between the cloud service provider and the cloud customer.

- **Shared Responsibility Model**: In this model, responsibilities vary depending on the service model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), with the provider managing the infrastructure and the customer managing the applications and data.

Illustrations such as the cloud definitional model, deployment models, and service models help to clarify the distinctions and relationships among cloud computing models and the shared responsibility between providers and customers.
