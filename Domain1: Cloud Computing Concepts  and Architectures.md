## Defining Cloud Computing

 NIST defines cloud computing as:
 Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a 
shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and 
services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service 
provider interaction.

 The ISO/IEC definition is very similar:
 Paradigm for enabling network access to a scalable and elastic pool of shareable physical or virtual 
resources with self-service provisioning and administration on-demand.
