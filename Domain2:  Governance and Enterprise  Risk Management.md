# CCSK Domain 2: Cloud Governance and Strategies – Study Content

## 1. Cloud Governance

### Key Concepts:
- **Cloud Governance Definition**: Cloud governance ensures that cloud strategies align with business goals while managing risks and complying with legal requirements.

### Governance Scope:
- **Shared Responsibility Model**: Security responsibilities are shared between the cloud provider (CSP) and the cloud customer (CSC).
- **Multi-Jurisdictional Challenges**: Cloud services may span multiple regions with different regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

### Focus Areas:
- **Cloud Adoption Drivers**: Focus on cost-efficiency and speed to market.
- **Governance Risks**: Misconfigurations, legal/regulatory complexities, and shared services risks.

### Practice:
- Review how cloud governance affects cloud service implementation and management.

## 2. The Governance Hierarchy

### Key Concepts:

#### Governance Frameworks:
- **Risk Frameworks**: E.g., NIST 800-30, ISO 27005 for cybersecurity risk management.
- **Program Frameworks**: E.g., NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), ISO 27001.
- **Control Frameworks**: E.g., NIST 800-53, CSA Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM).

#### Governance Documents:
- **Policies**: Broad security requirements (e.g., access control).
- **Control Objectives**: Specific desired outcomes for risk minimization.
- **Technical Standards**: Detailed security measures (e.g., MFA enforcement).

### Focus Areas:
- Align governance with the organization’s regulatory, business, and risk requirements.
- Define a governance hierarchy for decision-making and accountability.

### Practice:
- Create governance policies and map them to specific control frameworks like ISO 27001.

## 3. Cloud Security Frameworks

### Key Concepts:
- **Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM)**: Comprehensive security control objectives across 17 domains, aligned with standards like ISO 27001 and PCI DSS.
- **Security, Trust, Assurance, and Risk (STAR) Registry**: Provides transparency into CSP security practices via CAIQ submissions and certifications.

### Focus Areas:
- Understand how CCM helps assess and improve cloud security.
- Learn the role of CSA STAR in improving trust and transparency in CSPs.

### Practice:
- Review how CCM can be used to map organizational security controls to cloud services.

## 4. Policies and Compliance

### Key Concepts:

#### Core Policies:
- **Information Security Policy**: Defines the general security posture and objectives.
- **Specific Policies**: Address areas like data protection, acceptable use, and identity management.

#### Compliance Requirements:
- National regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and industry-specific standards (e.g., PCI DSS).

### Focus Areas:
- **Policy Enforcement**: Ensure security policies are supported by control objectives and technical standards.
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Establish processes for continuous compliance and reporting across jurisdictions.

### Practice:
- Write a data security policy and map it to GDPR requirements.
