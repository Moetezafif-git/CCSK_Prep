1. Governance in Cloud Computing
Definition: Governance involves the policies, processes, and internal controls that dictate how an organization manages operations and compliance. Cloud computing alters governance because the organization is now working with external providers (in public cloud models), but governance cannot be fully outsourced. Key Exam Points:

Governance remains the organization's responsibility, even when using external cloud providers.
Contracts are the main tool for extending governance to cloud providers.
Supplier assessments and third-party audits validate the cloud provider’s adherence to governance.
2. Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) in the Cloud
Definition: ERM focuses on managing the organization’s overall risk, including risks related to cloud adoption. In cloud computing, responsibility for managing risk is shared between the provider and the customer. Key Exam Points:

The shared responsibility model is crucial: cloud providers manage specific risks, but the customer is always ultimately responsible for their data and operations.
Know the importance of risk tolerance: The organization should assess which assets can be placed in the cloud based on acceptable levels of risk.
Contracts and documentation are critical tools for managing risk across cloud providers.
3. Tools of Cloud Governance and Risk Management
Definition: Organizations use contracts, assessments, and compliance reporting to ensure cloud providers meet governance and risk requirements. Key Tools:

Contracts: The primary governance tool, defining roles, responsibilities, and service level agreements (SLAs) between customer and provider.
Supplier Assessments: Evaluating a provider’s financial stability, legal compliance, and security practices.
Compliance Reporting: External audits and certifications that verify cloud providers’ adherence to security controls.
Key Exam Points:

Understand the role of contracts in cloud governance and how they define responsibility.
Familiarize yourself with third-party audits like SOC 2, ISO 27001, and CSA STAR for assessing cloud provider security.
4. Risk Management Trade-offs in Cloud Computing
Definition: Cloud adoption introduces new challenges in managing risk due to reduced control over infrastructure and reliance on contracts for security. Key Trade-offs:

Reduced Physical Control: You don’t manage the infrastructure, requiring reliance on provider audits and controls.
Proactive Contract Management: Risk management relies on continuous assessment of provider contracts and their compliance with SLAs.
Residual Risk: Even after provider audits, customers must manage remaining risks, using encryption or other controls to mitigate them.
Key Exam Points:

Understand the implications of reduced physical control in the public cloud.
Know how to manage residual risk using additional security controls such as encryption and monitoring.
5. Governance and Risk Differences by Service Model
Definition: The degree of control and governance varies significantly between cloud service models (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS). Key Differences:

SaaS: Most governance is handled by the provider, leaving customers responsible mainly for access control and data governance.
PaaS: Customers manage application security and configurations, while the provider handles the infrastructure.
IaaS: Customers have the most control, managing the security of the entire stack except the basic infrastructure.
Key Exam Points:

Know the level of responsibility across SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS.
Be able to explain the role of governance and risk management for each service model.
