### Sample Questions from Domains 1-12

#### 1. What does the Shared Responsibility Model in cloud governance imply?
- **A.** Both the CSP and CSC have distinct responsibilities in securing cloud environments.
- **B.** The CSC is responsible for patching all cloud infrastructure.
- **C.** The CSC manages data encryption, while the CSP handles access control.
- **D.** The CSP is solely responsible for all security controls.
- **Correct Answer:** **A.** Both the CSP and CSC have distinct responsibilities in securing cloud environments.
- **Explanation:** The Shared Responsibility Model implies that security responsibilities are divided between the CSP and the CSC, with each having distinct roles in ensuring cloud security.

#### 2. What can a cloud security process model be used for?
- **A.** Provider selection
- **B.** Design architectures
- **C.** Identify control gaps
- **D.** Implement compliance controls
- **E.** All of the above
- **Correct Answer:** **E.** All of the above.
- **Explanation:** Recommendations on page 26 suggest using a cloud security process model to select providers, design architectures, identify control gaps, and implement compliance controls. It should be tailored to each project.

#### 3. Incident Response processes must be updated for serverless computing.
- **True** or **False**
- **Correct Answer:** **True**
- **Explanation:** Page 152 recommends updating incident response processes when using serverless compute.

#### 4. Containers provide security isolation.
- **True** or **False**
- **Correct Answer:** **False**
- **Explanation:** Containers donâ€™t provide full security isolation, but they do offer task segregation. Virtual machines typically provide better security isolation (page 98).

#### 5. What can be used to help model data handling and controls for data security?
- **A.** Data Security Lifecycle
- **B.** SSDLC
- **C.** NIST RMF
- **D.** Enterprise Risk Management
- **E.** Information Risk Management
- **Correct Answer:** **A.** Data Security Lifecycle

#### 6. What is the primary advantage of using Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools in the cloud?
- **A.** They encrypt data at rest
- **B.** They provide backup services
- **C.** They improve data retrieval speed
- **D.** They prevent unauthorized data transfers and identify sensitive data
- **Correct Answer:** **D.** They prevent unauthorized data transfers and identify sensitive data.
- **Explanation:** DLP tools monitor and prevent unauthorized transfers of sensitive data.

#### 7. Attestations and certifications are valid for what duration?
- **A.** 3 Months
- **B.** 6 Months
- **C.** 1 Year
- **D.** For duration of contract
- **E.** There is no period of validity
- **Correct Answer:** **E.** There is no period of validity.
- **Explanation:** Certifications are point-in-time activities and may not be valid at any future point (page 58).

#### 8. In IaaS, there are generally two macro layers to infrastructure: the raw, physical and logical resources for resource pools and the virtual/abstracted infrastructure. Who manages each?
- **A.** Provider defines and manages both
- **B.** Customer defines and manages both
- **C.** Cloud Broker defines and manages both
- **D.** Provider manages resource pool; customer manages virtual infrastructure
- **E.** Customer manages resource pool; provider manages virtual infrastructure
- **Correct Answer:** **D.** Provider manages resource pool; customer manages virtual infrastructure.

#### 9. What is a Third-Party Attestation?
- **A.** Witness account of a crime
- **B.** An auditor expressing an opinion of deployed security controls
- **C.** A company making a statement of deployed security controls
